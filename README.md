## Problem and Idea
This app was built to allow students of the University of Jos to prepare for their computer-based exams more effeciently an effectively. Although students had been taking computer-based exams for a few years years, there was no convenient and affordable way for them to access the past questions. The best solution at the time was for students to make bulky paper photocopies or take pictures of the past questions. 
Also, the students who made paper photocopies typically did so a few days to the exam and discarded them shortly afterwards. Using this app minimizes paper usage and [helps the environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_impact_of_paper).

## Solution
My solution, CBT Practice, allows students of the University to practice on their android mobile devices. The students had access to instand feedback on their performance as well as corrections after taking the practice exam.

## User access
Users are able to access the app's content for a fee of ‚Ç¶200. This fee could either be paid online on the app itself or used to buy a paper PIN which looks like this.
If you would like me to waive the fee so you could test the app or evaluate my work, try one of the PINS in the postproximate image. If none work, kindly contact me.

## User support
Phone numbers of support personnel were provided within the app, but the most common way for users to receive support was the [CBT Practice WhatsApp group](https://chat.whatsapp.com/I9aDaWoaxydJJxcu9f7sQv).

## Bringing this to another school
This application currently only works in the [University of Jos](https://www.unijos.edu.ng/). If you would like to work with me to bring something like this to your school, send me an email.
